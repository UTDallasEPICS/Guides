# Tech stack options

For web projects, use Nuxt/Next for new projects. In some cases, we may need only a server - use Node with H3. If we only need an SPA, use Vue/React.

For projects that use Nuxt/Next, you MUST use the built in server handling. Do NOT create a standalone server without mentor approval.

For web project databases, you may choose between MySQL, Postgres, or SQLite. Either way, you will end up using Prisma for database schema management.

We use AWS for our cloud infrastructure, unless there are partner specific requirements.

We use docker containers for running infrastructure locally.

Students using Windows as their personal machine will need to setup WSL.

For non-web projects, tech stack is likely to be defined by the partner needs - we don't have many of these in the first place, so we don't have a good standard system yet.
