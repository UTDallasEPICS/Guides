# Policies

- All tasks must have an issue created
- All branches must be named with the syntax `dev/studentname/issue#`
- All branches must be merged and cleaned out by the final presentation
- All PRs must link to issues that they close
- Do not create your own repositories/forks
- All projects with a database must use Prisma
- Do NOT merge branches locally and then push them - push the branch and create a PR
- All feature branches must stay updated
- Do NOT commit node_modules - make sure .gitignore is properly configured. Most scaffolds should handle this automatically.
- Branches, PRs, and issues are reviewed as part of the mid semester and final presentations.
