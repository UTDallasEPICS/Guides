# Guides

In here you will find various guides and notes. All of these have been prepared by current and previous EPICS students, mentors, and staff members.

## How to Use These Guides

Each of these guides covers a different aspect of a typical web application developed in EPICS. For all students, we recommend starting with Taz's videos (link below).
