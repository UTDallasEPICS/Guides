# Node
Node is a Javascript runtime that can run on servers. This lets us use one language across the whole stack, both frontend and backend. There are some differences between Node and the browser runtimes, but this gap has decreased as browser features get ported over. 

# NVM

NVM is the Node Version Manager. This tool helps manage different versions of Node, which really is only needed if you are working with really old projects that can't be upgraded or if you want to work with experimental versions, but it is way simpler than installing Node yourself. You can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once you have installed NVM, you can install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of node using `nvm install --lts`. 

# NPM

NPM is the Node Package Manager. It manages dependencies and provides some additional tooling for JS projects, both frontend and backend.
