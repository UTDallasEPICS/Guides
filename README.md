# Guides

In here you will find various guides and notes. All of these have been prepared by current and previous EPICS students, mentors, and staff members.

## How to Use These Guides

Each of these guides covers a different aspect of a typical web application developed in EPICS. For all students, we recommend starting with Taz's videos (link below). From there, many other guides are provided which will be useful as you progress through the semester.

### [Taz's Getting Started Videos](https://utdallas.box.com/v/epics-cs-introduction-videos)

We recommend all students working on CS projects watch these videos. Additionally, **watching all of these videos counts as one of your two required workshops for the semester**.
These videos cover the following 5 topics:

- Git (a command line tool for code management)
- GitHub (a web application built around Git)
- Bash (the command line)
- Clients, servers, and databases
- Browser Developer Tools

### Other Documents

These documents go into more specific detail about various processes, tools, and frameworks that will be useful for web app development.
