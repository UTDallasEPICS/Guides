# Tech stack options

For web projects, use Nuxt for new projects. In some cases, we may need only a server - use Node with H3. If we only need an SPA, use Vue.

For web project databases, you may choose between MySQL and Postgres. Either way, you will end up using Prisma for database schema management for web projects.

We use AWS for our cloud infrastructure, unless there are partner specific requirements.

We use docker containers for running infrastructure locally.

Students using Windows as their personal machine will need to setup WSL.

For non-web projects, tech stack is likely to be defined by the partner needs - we don't have many of these in the first place, so we don't have a good standard system yet.
